The aim of this project is to ease the life of a developer by providing a simple architecture in which he can write code for JSON Rest based API (object oriented way) and serve it through either a URL or aa multi-threaded web socket server. So you have the option to write API code once and then serve/use in multiple ways. The web-socket server in this project is purely built in PHP 7.2 using STREAM SOCKET, PTHREADS version 3.16 or higher.
